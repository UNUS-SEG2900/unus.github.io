Our website will be lively and energetic mirroring the city feel. We hope to use bright colours,
lively fonts, and interactive elements to engage the user.

excited while using the website:

Images:
=======
	Background images:
	==================
	Images will apear static behind sections and a parellax effect will cause the new image to replace the
	other once scrolled down.
	All background images will be in black and white, to follow the colour scheme.
	All images will potray a city, roads or cars, to reflect our app's feature set.
	
	Profile images:
	===============
	The profile pictures used in the About Us page will be round to reflect how most profile pictures are
	displayed.
	Those pictures won't have to be in black and white, since profile pictures look more lively in color.


Iconography
===========
We will focus on using icons that have a 'flat' design, clean and matte finish to the whole site.
For our app's icon, see the HTML provided.

Typography
==========
We will be using Montserrat for larger headings and Quicksand for smaller content sections of the site.

	Headings
	==
	Headings won't be bold to follow the page's clean look.
	Primary headings will have an orange bottom border whereas secondary headings will be smaller and have
	the border to the right with a bit of padding between the border and the text
	
	Paragraphs
	==========
	Paragrphs' colors will be black or white, depending on the background.
	However, important content such as the pricing will be displayed in orange to attract the user's attention.


Links
=====
Links will not be underlined, will turn orange once hovered over, and return to normal once clicked

Buttons
=======
Buttons will be flat with sharp corners and the colour of the button will change when hovered over
Depending on the button's importance, it will be orange and change to grey when hovered over or grey and will
turn orange when hovered over.
For example, the Download button will be orange since we want people to download it. However, since the About us
button isn't as important, it will be grey.

Navigation
==========
A navigation menu will be displayed at the top of the page. It will be sticky, meaning it will stay in place
as the user scrolls down the page. 
The backgrounndo of the menu will be white. However, the active page will be shown in grey so the user can
easily know where he is. Also, when hovered over, the links will become orange.
